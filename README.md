Minimax AI in Python for A Board Game as part of a Project in Usask's Artificial Intelligence class

Credit to my partner Agis Daniels for his part in the project; building the board, modifying my minimax code and assisting me in my learning of Python.

Note that this was created in Pycharm and so might be best to open in Pycharm.
